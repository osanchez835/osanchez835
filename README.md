### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name Oscar Sanchez from Waukegan Illinois. I always knew I wanted a future in technology but didn't really know where I fit in. Technology is a very important part of all of our lives, with us having to rely on phones and computers for a lot of daily tasks, but one piece of tech I have always been drawn to are video games. To me video games have always been there for me as a way to relax/wind down and I would like to help in its development to be able to recreate this experience for others. 
After graduating from Waukegan High School, I decided to continue my education at the College of Lake County where I took my general education classes, learned the basics of Java, and obtained an Associates Degree of Science.
I have transferred and am now studying computer science at The University of Illinois Chicago where I am currently learning  about C and C++.
My plans for the future include learning C# and learning about game engines such as Unity. I'm also currently looking for internships.
